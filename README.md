# AI Image Generator Prompt-to-Image Creation using OpenAI API

AI Image Generator using OpenAI API is a web-based Generative AI application that allows users to create high-quality images from simple text prompts. The project uses OpenAIâ€™s Image Generation API to transform natural language descriptions into visuals of different sizes and styles.

The application features a clean and responsive interface built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind + custom styling), and JavaScript. Users can:

Enter a prompt or keyword to describe the desired image.

Choose the image resolution (from 256px up to 7680px).

Select the number of images to generate.

Download images with a simple double-click.

The project highlights the capabilities of Generative AI in creative design and demonstrates real-world integration of AI models into web applications. It can be extended for use in graphic design, content creation, and digital art platforms.
